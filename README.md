Do note that the script might not work 100%.
Without VMSphere or VCenter it is difficult to make the script work 100%.

The script is crafted based of the estimated audit output.

Most of the CIS Benchmark that is done manually does not have an audit or remediation,
not sure why CIS would include it in if they do not have a way to audit or remediate.
