Remediation: 
The remediation procedures to properly segregate SAN activity are SAN vendor or 
product-specific. 
In general, with ESXi hosts, use a single-initiator zoning or a single-initiator-single-target 
zoning. The latter is a preferred zoning practice. Using the more restrictive zoning 
prevents problems and misconfigurations that can occur on the SAN.

Audit: 
To verify this information utilize the vSphere interface as follows: 
1. Select the VM then select Actions followed by Edit Settings. 
2. Click on the VM Options tab then expand Advanced. 
3. Click on EDIT CONFIGURATION. 
4. Verify that ethernet0.filter1.name = dv-filter1 where ethernet0 is the 
   network adapter interface of the virtual machine that is to be protected, filter1 
   is the number of the filter that is being used, and dv-filter1 is the name of the 
   particular data path kernel module that is protecting the VM. 
   • If dvfilter access should not be permitted: Verify that the following is NOT listed 
     ethernet0.filter1.name = dv-filter. 
5. Ensure that the name of the data path kernel is set correctly. 

You may also perform the following to determine if dvfilter access should be permitted 
via the VMX file:
1. Verify that the following is in the VMX file: ethernet0.filter1.name = dv
   filter1 where ethernet0 is the network adapter interface of the virtual machine 
   that is to be protected, filter1 is the number of the filter that is being used, and 
   dv-filter1 is the name of the particular data path kernel module that is 
   protecting the VM. 
   • If dvfilter access should not be permitted: Verify that the following is not in the 
     VMX file: ethernet0.filter1.name = dv-filter1. 
2. Ensure that the name of the data path kernel is set correctly.

Remediation:
To set this configuration utilize the vSphere interface as follows: 
1. Select the VM then select Actions followed by Edit Settings. 
2. Click on the VM Options tab then expand Advanced. 
3. Click on EDIT CONFIGURATION. 
4. Remove the value from ethernet0.filter1.name = dv-filter. 
   • Parameters are removed when no value is present 
5. Click OK.

You may also configure a VM to allow dvfilter access via the following method in the 
VMX file: 
1. Configure the following in the VMX file: ethernet0.filter1.name = dv-filter1 
   where ethernet0 is the network adapter interface of the virtual machine that is to 
   be protected, filter1 is the number of the filter that is being used, and dv-filter1 
   is the name of the particular data path kernel module that is protecting the VM. 
   • If dvfilter access should not be permitted: Remove the following from its VMX 
     file: ethernet0.filter1.name = dv-filter1. 
2. Set the name of the data path kernel correctly.
